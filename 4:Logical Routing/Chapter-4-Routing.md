# 4 NSX-T Logical Routing

BGP is awesome!

The logical routing capability in the NSX-T platform provides the ability to interconnect both virtual and physical workloads deployed in different logical L2 networks. NSX-T enables the creation of network elements like segments (Layer 2 broadcast domains) and gateways (routers) in software as logical constructs and embeds them in the hypervisor layer, abstracted from the underlying physical hardware. Since these network elements are logical entities, multiple gateways can be created in an automated and agile fashion.
 
The previous chapter showed how to create segments; this chapter focuses on how gateways provide connectivity between different logical L2 networks. Figure 4 1 shows both logical and physical view of a routed topology connecting segments/logical switches on multiple hypervisors. Virtual machines “Web1” and “Web2” are connected to “overlay Segment 1” while “App1” and “App2” are connected to “overlay Segment 2”.

In a data center, traffic is categorized as East-West (E-W) or North-South (N-S) based on the origin and destination of the flow. When virtual or physical workloads in a data center communicate with the devices external to the data center (e.g., WAN, Internet), the traffic is referred to as North-South traffic. The traffic between workloads confined within the data center is referred to as East-West traffic. In modern data centers, more than 70% of the traffic is East-West.

For a multi-tiered application where the web tier needs to talk to the app tier and the app tier needs to talk to the database tier and, these different tiers sit in different subnets. Every time a routing decision is made, the packet is sent to the router. Traditionally, a centralized router would provide routing for these different tiers. With VMs that are hosted on same the ESXi or KVM hypervisor, traffic will leave the hypervisor multiple times to go to the centralized router for a routing decision, then return to the same hypervisor; this is not optimal.

NSX-T is uniquely positioned to solve these challenges as it can bring networking closest to the workload. Configuring a Gateway via NSX-T Manager instantiates a local distributed gateway on each hypervisor. For the VMs hosted (e.g., “Web 1”, “App 1”) on the same hypervisor, the E-W traffic does not need to leave the hypervisor for routing.
